I use these personal notes to help me remember articles and books that I have read. I hope they might be a helpful summary and introduction for others. However, these notes are _not_ intended to be an exhaustive annotated bibliography nor a complete academic review of the current status of research. These are just my personal notes of material that I have already read or references to material that I hope to read soon.

## Strategies to help students

### Books - Recommended

    * The explanation of the reading process in ch. 4 correlates closely to what I have observed in GS.
    * "Trigger word list": approximately 200 short, commonly used words that are difficult for dyslexics to master. Davis claims that these are difficult words, because they cannot be pictured in the mind.
        * See also: [Problems with small words](https://blog.dyslexia.com/problems-with-small-words/) and [How to spot trouble with trigger words](https://blog.dyslexia.com/trouble-with-trigger-words/).

    * Typing

    * "dysgraphia" is not in the index. There are only a couple of brief mentions of writing and handwriting.
* Brock L. Eide M.D. M.A., Fernette F. Eide M.D. 2011. [The Dyslexic Advantage: Unlocking the Hidden Potential of the Dyslexic Brain](https://wccls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1676763143).

        * I = Interconnected Reasoning
        * N = Narrative Reasoning
        * D = Dynamic Reasoning
    * Ch 25 "Reading", explains strategies to improve reading. e.g.
        * Explain the general idea of what student will read _before_ they read it.
        * Make sure student knows all the words that will be encountered in the text.
        * Tutor reads first while student follows along. Then the student reads the same passage.

    * Not available through Summit County Libraries.
    * The author is a teacher who is dyslexic herself.
    * The spelling exercises seemed odd to me, but the "hand skills" and "practice tasks" to improve writing looked useful.
    * Handwriting improvement exercises
        * Hand skills
            * Using the hand that you write with, crumple up a piece of paper.
            * Using a soft ball, roll the ball around on a hard surface, using the hand that you write with. Roll the ball up to your elbow and back and roll it around with your hand for a second time, moving it to the outer edge of your fingers this time.
            * Using the hand that you write with, break placsticine (play-doh) into 3 small pieces. Then use your thumb, the finger next to it and your middle finger to create a pincer/triangle shape. When that position has been formed, use your thumb and fingers to roll the plasticine into a ball.
        * Practice tasks with lined paper
            * Within the lines, draw a series of parallel vertical lines. Try to make them straight and the same length.
            * Within the lines, draw a series of horizontal liines. Try to make them straight and the same length. Try to fit three lines between each pair of lines on the page.
            * Draw clouds inside the lines to practise the curves of some letters.
            * Repeat as often as possible and monitor improvement in your handwriting.
        * Air brush
            * Use a large paint brush to draw straight lines in the air.
            * Use the same brush to draw out a letter that they wanted to improve whilst closing their eyes and thinking of a perfect image of that letter.

### Books - Not recommended
* Margaret Rooke. 2018. [Dyslexia Is My Superpower (most of the Time): Interviews](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1159836152).
    * [Summit County Library](https://summit.marmot.org/Record/.b57097793).
    * Short essays by children who have dyslexia.
    * I do not recommend it as a way to learn more about dyslexia or as a way to learn techniques for helping a dyslexic student.
* Virginia Wise Berninger. 2016. [Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, OWL LD, and Dyscalculia: Lessons From Science and Teaching](https://wccls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2661278143). 2nd edition.
    * Summit County Library: [Interlibrary Loan](https://encore.coalliance.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb34321141__Orightresult?lang=eng&suite=def).
    * Has many teaching tips for the classroom teacher about how to cover language studies subjects.
    * Many of the tips seemed to be material that would be covered anyway in class. It was not clear to me how any of the tips applied specifically to learning disabilities or dyslexia in particular.
    * Even with the teaching tips, the book is very academic. Might be good if you are looking for research on dyslexia, because there are many references.

## Sight words
* [Sight Words / Tricky Words](https://www.dyslexicadvantage.org/sight-words-tricky-words/).
    * "Sight words are words that must be memorized by sight, rather than being sounded out phonetically. Sight words are important to learn because once children are able to read the most common 100 sight words, they can read up to 50% of most children’s literature. Mastery of the top 300 words, gives students access to 75% of what is printed in most children’s literature."
