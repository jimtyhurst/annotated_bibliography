Agile Alliance [Experience Report](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/).
    * This short article explains how the author's team handled some problems of mob programming remotely.
    * He concludes, "Given the right tools and conditions, remote mob programming is as effective as in-person mob programming."
    * "Remote mob programming pairs well with technical and other practices, such as test driven development, continuous integration, push button deployments, limiting work in process, and eliminating waste."

    * "asynchronous virtual brainstorming" overcomes problems from in-person brainstorming.
    * Leaders should not fool themselves that using traditional in-person brainstorming will result in maximizing innovation.
    * Tsipursky describes a 7-step process for asynchronous brainstorming that provides more and better ideas than traditional brainstorming, maximizing the number of novel ideas, and therefore gaining an innovation advantage.

    * Kati Peditto: "There are tons of studies on the positive benefits of teleworking, but most of that research is interviews and surveys with people who have self-selected into remote work".
    * "people who have already built strong social and professional networks may not suffer much from the lack of face-to-face contact at the office, but for those still trying to make such ties, remote work can be alienating."
    * "with no place to go to but just as many professional obligations, people working from home might have the flexibility to do everything except make new friends."
    * "Even those who self-select into the work-from-home “lifestyle” report feeling distant from new professional opportunities, outside their companies as well as inside"
    * "A dispersed workforce means that employees have to go out of their way to compare experiences with one another, and that those with relatively little power have a tougher time sensing who their allies might be."

    * This is not specifically about remote work, but the concepts of organizational structure and the 7 practices are especially relevant to organizations that work remotely.
        1. Autonomy: Claim your personal leadership.
        2. Purpose: The invisible leader.
        3. Meetings: Sharing the responsibilities and accountability.
        4. Transparency: Open is effective and efficient.
        5. Decision making: Sharing the power.
        6. Learning and development: Self-directed and collectively held.

    * Today there are three Americas. At one extreme are the brain hubs, cities like San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Durham, with a well-educated labor force and a strong innovation sector. Their workers are among the most productive, creative, and best paid on the planet. At the other extreme are cities once dominated by traditional manufacturing, which are declining rapidly, losing jobs and residents. In the middle are a number of cities that could go either way.
