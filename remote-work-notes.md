    * The [Dingel and Neiman (2020)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26948) measure of suitability for remote work does a remarkably good job of predicting the industry level patterns of remote work.

    * Classifies occupations that cannot be performed at home, based on a list of criteria, e.g.
        * Average respondent says they deal with violent people at least once a week
        * Majority of respondents say they work outdoors every day
    * "Our classification implies that 37 percent of US jobs can plausibly be performed at home."

    * "According to the [SBU](https://www.frbatlanta.org/research/surveys/business-uncertainty.aspx) results, the anticipated share of working days at home is set to triple after the pandemic ends—rising from 5.5 percent to 16.6 percent of all working days."
    * "Perhaps even more striking, firms anticipate that 10 percent of their full-time workforce will be working from home five days a week."
