    * 3 key takeaways:
        * The benefits of a community existing on a platform that was created specifically for their community and tailored to its mission
        * The truth about venture capital funding in the community industry
        * The impact of showing up for your community consistently and with deep commitment to its purpose
    * Building a community is a long, slow effort, but venture capital is looking to grow fast for quick results. They do not work well together.
    * Providing _access_ is often a great way to reward active members, e.g. preview products, meet leaders, early information, etc.

        1. Support
        2. Product
        3. Acquisition
        4. Contribution
        5. Engagement
        6. Success
    * Four levels of participation:
        1. passive members
        2. active members
        3. power members
        4. leaders

    * Isenberg's blog posts and podcast appearances talk about "unbundling" communities, i.e. developing specific software customized for a particular community, rather than that community hosting on a generic platform like Facebook Groups.
    * Isenberg also talks a lot about how to monetize communities.
    * One of [his interviews](https://pando.com/2020/08/25/greg-isenberg-unbundling-internet/) provides a good overview of these topics.

        * Advantage of going online during COVID-19 was global reach. Many people participated in online conference from other countries.
        * Problem: Replicating the personal networking that happens in-person at a conference.

    * Author is the founder of [Freelancers Union](https://www.freelancersunion.org/).
    * Focus on workers uniting to provide their own safety net.
    * Part 1 is a history of mutualist societies.
    * Three characteristics of mutualist societies.
        1. Mutualist organizations have a **social purpose**: to solve a social problem for a community. A mutualist organization exists to serve its members, not to make a profit.
        2. Mutualist organizations must have an independent, sutainable **economic mechanism**. Revenues must exceed expenses. In other words, a mutualist organization must have a way of making money.
        3. Mutualist organizations have a **long-term focus**. They are intergenerational institutions with leadership infrastructures and capital strategies that equip them to serve future generations. They are built to outlast their members.
    * Part 2 plans for a mutualist future that grows structures to replace government and corporate employers, who are no longer caring sufficiently for workers.
    * Chapter 10. _The Future of You: How to Build_ has practical advice for how to build a mutualist organization from the ground up.
    * She draws a distinction between "a summation of individuals" and a "collective of individuals", where most modern technology platforms are just gathering individuals, but not facilitating real interaction to foster long-term in-person or connected human relationships.
    * "These platforms may galvanize individuals quickly, but they don't build lasting collective institutions."
* Holly Firestone. 2020-05-22. [Oh SNAP! A Community Incentivization Framework](https://hollyfirestone.medium.com/oh-snap-d0dfad89e79f).
    * SNAP: Status, Networking, Access, and Perks.
        * Status: Titles, badges, identity.
        * Networking: Opportunities to network and connect with others in an exclusive group/community of people like them.
        * Access: Special access to product managers, executives, beta testing/feedback opportunities, product roadmaps.
        * Perks: Free tickets to events, swag, free training, special offers.
    * Bringing in the right people to build this foundation takes time.
    * It's not quick, it's not easy, and in the beginning, it's not scalable. It's about developing personal relationships, building trust, and most importantly, having a shared set of values that span across the company and the community.
    * Incentivization: e.g. perks/swag, top contributor programs, community feedback, and community culture+values.
* Carrie Melissa Jones, Charles Vogl. 2020. [Building Brand Communities: How Organizations Succeed by Creating Belonging](https://www.buildingbrandcommunities.com/).
    * Common ways authentic communities serve organizational goals:
        * Innovation
        * Customer and stakeholder retention
        * Marketing
        * Customer service
        * Talent recruitment and retention
        * Advancing movements

    * Three community engagement models:
        * Consumers: pull together people who share a common interest.
        * Champions: actively delivering work that champions the success of the community and its members. The work is primarily done as individual contributors.
        * Collaborators: members actively work together as a team on shared projects.
    * Must be clear on what _value_ you provide to participants.
    * Measure and assess work through unambiguous metrics.
    * Measure both _action_ and _validation_, i.e. whether the action is any good or not.
    * 10 culture cores (p. 182-188).
    * Build an engagement strategy.
* David Spinks. 2018-09-26. [The 7P's of Community: A simple framework for building belonging](https://cmxhub.com/the-7ps-of-community/).
    1. Purpose: Clearly define your goal.
    2. People: Choose the right members and leaders.
    3. Place: Gather in a compelling space.
    4. Participation: Take your members on a journey.
    5. Policy: Enforce a clear set of rules.
    6. Promotion: Start small then scale.
    7. Performance: Measure everything.

    * Defines a continuum of organization types and then discusses how to move along the continuum.
    * Emphasis on self-managing, small groups of workers.

    * Penguin: open source.
    * Leviathan: from Thomas Hobbes: governments must step in to control us, so that our self-interest does not destroy one another.

### Lessons Learned From Growing International Communities
* Erika Batista, VP of International, [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/). erika@beondeck.com
* _Abstract_: In this session, Erika will share her experiences and lessons learned from leading On Deck's international expansion and from growing The Family, one of Europe's leading tech accelerators. This session will be packed with real-world examples and tactical advice.
* Lessons learned:
    * Do things that don't scale, again. Early stage startups do this, but it also applies to new markets.
    * When you launch a new market, 80% of the work is "invisible". Less about PR and more about building influence and educating the market on your value proposition.
    * In a strong community, members are willing to do irrational things for each other (and for you). Your job is to build high trust among those members.
    * Create ownership. Referrals are the biggest driver of growth for On Deck.
    * Different markets will demand different things from your community.
    * Don't get hung up on org structures. Focus on the problem you are trying to solve vs optimizing for your existing org. Solve for the next 3-6-12 months, because your org will probably change drastically in a year.
    * The most improtant decision is who you hire to lead the markewt. Before there is a brand, people follow people. Hire for the next 18 months, because the person for the current size is not necessarily right for the next level of growth.

### Community-First Programming
* Katie Ray, Community Manager, Sales Hacker.
* _Abstract_: Community Managers have been building programs to hopefully engage and inspire community members. But are we doing it the right way? Are we building what our members are wanting and even needing? Let's look at the different types of community programs, ways to get community members involved, and how this will evolve as we shift back into in person events.

### Mining for Gold In Communities
* Greg Isenberg, CEO/Co-Founder, Late Checkout
* _Abstract_: In this session, Greg Isenberg will give you a page from his community playbook. Starting with a brief overview to set the stage, Greg will focus his talk on the 6-step framework he developed to unearth community "gold" and the insights he and his team use to develop unique community-based products, that users love. Participants can expect to walk away with a simple, step-by-step, actionable and proven method that they can use to build their own communities and products.

### Community-Owned, No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees
* Sahil Lavingia, CEO, Gumroad
* David Spinks, Co-founder, CMX
* _Abstract_: The internet has enabled new ways of working, but we’re just starting to see them unfold. In this fireside chat with Gumroad's CEO, you'll learn a new way on how to make work work. You'll learn to say no. There are a lot of different ways and Gumroad is just one. Hear about becoming a minimalist entrepreneur, community crowdfunding, and changing the future.
