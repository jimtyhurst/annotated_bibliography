    * 3 key takeaways:
        * The benefits of a community existing on a platform that was created specifically for their community and tailored to its mission
        * The truth about venture capital funding in the community industry
        * The impact of showing up for your community consistently and with deep commitment to its purpose
    * Building a community is a long, slow effort, but venture capital is looking to grow fast for quick results. They do not work well together.
    * Providing _access_ is often a great way to reward active members, e.g. preview products, meet leaders, early information, etc.

        1. Support
        2. Product
        3. Acquisition
        4. Contribution
        5. Engagement
        6. Success
    * Four levels of participation:
        1. passive members
        2. active members
        3. power members
        4. leaders

    * Isenberg's blog posts and podcast appearances talk about "unbundling" communities, i.e. developing specific software customized for a particular community, rather than that community hosting on a generic platform like Facebook Groups.
    * Isenberg also talks a lot about how to monetize communities.
    * One of [his interviews](https://pando.com/2020/08/25/greg-isenberg-unbundling-internet/) provides a good overview of these topics.

        * Advantage of going online during COVID-19 was global reach. Many people participated in online conference from other countries.
        * Problem: Replicating the personal networking that happens in-person at a conference.

    * Focus on workers uniting to provide their own safety net.
    * Part 1 is a history of mutualist societies.
    * Three characteristics of mutualist societies.
        1. Mutualist organizations have a **social purpose**: to solve a social problem for a community. A mutualist organization exists to serve its members, not to make a profit.
        2. Mutualist organizations must have an independent, sutainable **economic mechanism**. Revenues must exceed expenses. In other words, a mutualist organization must have a way of making money.
        3. Mutualist organizations have a **long-term focus**. They are intergenerational institutions with leadership infrastructures and capital strategies that equip them to serve future generations. They are built to outlast their members.
    * Part 2 plans for a mutualist future that grows structures to replace government and corporate employers, who are no longer caring sufficiently for workers.
    * Chapter 10. _The Future of You: How to Build_ has practical advice for how to build a mutualist organization from the ground up.
    * She draws a distinction between "a summation of individuals" and a "collective of individuals", where most modern technology platforms are just gathering individuals, but not facilitating real interaction to foster long-term in-person or connected human relationships.
    * "These platforms may galvanize individuals quickly, but they don't build lasting collective institutions."

    * SNAP: Status, Networking, Access, and Perks.
        * Status: Titles, badges, identity.
        * Networking: Opportunities to network and connect with others in an exclusive group/community of people like them.
        * Access: Special access to product managers, executives, beta testing/feedback opportunities, product roadmaps.
        * Perks: Free tickets to events, swag, free training, special offers.
    * Bringing in the right people to build this foundation takes time.
    * It's not quick, it's not easy, and in the beginning, it's not scalable. It's about developing personal relationships, building trust, and most importantly, having a shared set of values that span across the company and the community.
    * Incentivization: e.g. perks/swag, top contributor programs, community feedback, and community culture+values.

        * Champions: actively delivering work that champions the success of the community and its members. The work is primarily done as individual contributors.
        * Collaborators: members actively work together as a team on shared projects.
    * Must be clear on what _value_ you provide to participants.
    * Measure and assess work through unambiguous metrics.
    * Measure both _action_ and _validation_, i.e. whether the action is any good or not.
    * 10 culture cores (p. 182-188).
    * Build an engagement strategy.
