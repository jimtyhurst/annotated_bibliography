    * Three characteristics of mutualist societies.
        1. Mutualist organizations have a **social purpose**: to solve a social problem for a community. A mutualist organization exists to serve its members, not to make a profit.
        2. Mutualist organizations must have an independent, sutainable **economic mechanism**. Revenues must exceed expenses. In other words, a mutualist organization must have a way of making money.
        3. Mutualist organizations have a **long-term focus**. They are intergenerational institutions with leadership infrastructures and capital strategies that equip them to serve future generations. They are built to outlast their members.
    * Part 2 plans for a mutualist future that grows structures to replace government and corporate employers, who are no longer caring sufficiently for workers.
    * Chapter 10. _The Future of You: How to Build_ has practical advice for how to build a mutualist organization from the ground up.
    * She draws a distinction between "a summation of individuals" and a "collective of individuals", where most modern technology platforms are just gathering individuals, but not facilitating real interaction to foster long-term in-person or connected human relationships.
    * "These platforms may galvanize individuals quickly, but they don't build lasting collective institutions."
