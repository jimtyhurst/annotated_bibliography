## Review of pre-tidyverse libraries
Abraham Mathew. 2019-08-18. [Packages for Getting Started with Time Series Analysis in R](https://mathewanalytics.com/packages-for-getting-started-with-time-series-analysis-in-r/). Blog post.

* Provides a brief survey of R libraries used for time series before `tidyverse` development became popular.
* [ts](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/ts.html) vs [xts](https://joshuaulrich.github.io/xts/) for representing time series data.
* [dynlm](https://rdrr.io/cran/dynlm/api/) for comparing regressors at different times. [usage](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dynlm/versions/0.3-6/topics/dynlm) documentation.
* [forecast](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/automatic-forecasting/) for time series forecasting.

## Time series libraries compatible with the `tidyverse`
### Rob Hyndman: R libraries

## Facebook: `prophet` package
* [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/): Forecasting at scale. home page.
* [prophet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=prophet) package: Automatic Forecasting Procedure.
    * "Implements a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well."
