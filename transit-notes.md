I use these personal notes to help me remember articles that I have read. I also hope that they might be a helpful summary and introduction for others. However, these notes are _not_ intended to be an exhaustive annotated bibliography nor a complete academic review of the current status of research. These are just my personal notes of material that I have already read or references to material that I hope to read soon.

[Laura Bliss](#laura-bliss).<a name="bliss-2019-shortcuts"></a> 2019. "Shortcuts" in Henry Grabar ([2019](#grabar-2019)).  
Explains how individual smart phone apps that suggest alternate routes to avoid traffic congestion are business apps that do not provide a solution for urban congestion as a whole.

[Laura Bliss](#laura-bliss). 2019-11-12. "[Navigation Apps Changed the Politics of Traffic](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/11/future-of-transportation-traffic-navigation-apps-google-maps/601684/)".

[Laura Bliss](#laura-bliss). 2019-08-09. "[The Map That Made Los Angeles Make Sense](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/08/thomas-guide-los-angeles-history-street-map-google-waze-app/591721/)".  
Discusses "the risk of maps that de-center the larger context in favor of the individual. ... When a group of drivers veers off a jammed highway on an app's recommendation, it can thicken congestion for surrounding commuters, even if a few drivers succeed in shaving a few minutes off their individual journeys."

[Laura Bliss](#laura-bliss). 2018-11-28. "[A U.S. Transit Atlas That Ranks the Best (and Worst) Cities for Bus and Rail](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/11/best-transit-american-cities-bus-rail-subway-service/576739/)".  
This article is a summary and review of Christof Spieler's book, "[Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit](#spieler-2018-trains-buses)".  
"Spieler's atlas illustrates how high-performing public transportation boils down to a handful of key tenets: the density and walkability of an area, and the connectivity, frequency, and reliability of the service. Finding the proper capacity to meet demand matters, too, as do speed and legible tools for navigating the system, he writes."

[Laramie Bowron](https://blog.goswift.ly/@laramie_44230). 2019-09-12. "[The Case for Revising Headways Policies](https://blog.goswift.ly/the-case-for-revising-headways-policies-7ddfb5ca1898)".  
"There's currently no standard in how most transit agencies measure the reliability of their [headways](#headway-def), and it's hurting the rider experience."

Ricky Burdett, Philipp Rode (eds). 2018. Shaping Cities in an Urban Age.  
Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/172236152).  
Public transport requirements leading to investment in high-capacity transport:

* Greater access to employment.
* Reduced commuting times.
* Reduced congestion.
* Better control of carbon emissions.

For example, Hong Kong: 79% of residents take public transport to work. Despite a 28% growth in population, commuting times have reduced by 50%. [p. 54]

Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1385609152).  

[p. 10] More people choose buses when they are a useful option for them -- when it's reasonably fast, affordable, and convenient. Decades of research by academics and public agencies show that this is determined mostly by factors such as how often the bus runs, how fast it is compared with alternatives, how reliable it is, and how safe riders feel.

[p. 17] Transit service that is useful to most people satisfies seven basic criteria:

* The service goes where you want to go.
* The service runs frequently enough that you don't have to think about it.
* The service is reasonably fast.
* The service is reliable (you don't have to worry about major delays).
* You can conveniently walk from the service to your final destination.
* The service is comfortable and feels safe.
* The service is affordable.

[Paul Mees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mees). 2009. [Transport for Suburbia: Beyond the Automobile Age](https://www.routledge.com/Transport-for-Suburbia-Beyond-the-Automobile-Age-1st-Edition/Mees/p/book/9781849774659).  
Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1400467152).  
This book argues that the secret of 'European-style' public transport lies in a generalizable model of network planning that has worked in places as diverse as rural Switzerland, the Brazilian city of Curitiba and the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. It shows how this model can be adapted to suburban, exurban and even rural areas to provide a genuine alternative to the car, and outlines the governance, funding and service planning policies that underpin the success of the world's best public transport systems.

[Christof Spieler](https://www.trainsbusespeople.org/christof-spieler). 2018<a name="spieler-2018-trains-buses"></a>. [Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit](https://islandpress.org/books/trains-buses-people). Available at [Multnomah Public Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/274953152), [Washington County Libraries](https://wccls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3524075143), and [Clackamas County Libraries](https://lincc.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/lincc/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:974020/one?qu=Trains%2C+Buses%2C+People&rt=false%7C%7C%7CTITLE%7C%7C%7CTitle).  
Includes maps of frequency of service against population density as a critical factor that affects ridership levels.  
Basics of successful transit:

* Density
    * Put transit in densely populated places.
    * Increase population density where transit is.
* Activity
    * Serve all trips.
    * Connect centers.
* Walkability
    * Optimize the quarter mile.
    * Create complete networks.
    * Create a great pedestrian environment.
    * Turn front doors to the pedestrian.
* Connectivity
    * Design networks to create connections.
    * Build hubs.
    * Unify fares.
* Frequency
    * Provide all-day frequent service.
* Travel Time
    * Measure access, not distance.
    * Optimize trip time, not speed.
    * Provide express service.
* Reliability
    * Minimize unreliability due to traffic.
    * Minimize unreliability due to boarding.
* Capacity
    * Provide enough capacity to meet demand.
* Legibility
    * Brand the network.
    * Identify lines.
    * Identify frequency.
    * Identify stops.
    * Clarify transfers.
    * Simplify networks.
    * Create a legible experience.

Recorded presentation on 2019-10-08: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Fx-2v6KC0) is a 47-minute presentation in Seattle followed by 11 minutes of questions. This presentation added one more dependency for increasing levels of ridership:

* Inclusivity

The book calls out Portland, Oregon for having poor land use with too much single house zoning, which limits the number of people who can use transit.

Nick Van Mead.<a name="van-mead-2019-bus"></a> "Riding the Bus in Dar Es Salaam" in Henry Grabar ([2019](#grabar-2019)).  
Despite the title, this chapter reviews bus rapid transit ([BRT](#brt-def)) in cities across the world.

[p. 67] Five features are needed to receive a [gold ranking](https://www.itdp.org/publication/the-brt-standard/) from the non-profit Institute for Transportation and Development Policy ([ITDP](https://www.itdp.org/)):

1. bus-only lanes separated from other traffic
2. bus lanes in the middle of the road, rather than on the edge
3. ticket payment and control at stations, rather than on board
4. general traffic kept clear of intersections
5. level boarding between the bus and station platform

[Jarrett Walker](https://humantransit.org/). 2012. [Human Transit: How Clearer Thinking About Public Transit Can Enrich Our Communities and Our Lives](https://humantransit.org/book).  
Available at [Multnomah Public Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/236687152), [Washington County Libraries](https://wccls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1774137143), and [Clackamas County Libraries](https://lincc.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/lincc/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:897360/ada?qu=Human+Transit&rt=false%7C%7C%7CTITLE%7C%7C%7CTitle).

[p. 24] Seven broad expectations that potential riders have of a transit service that they would consider riding:

1. It takes me _where_ I want to go.
2. It takes me _when_ I want to go.
3. It is a good use of my _time_.
4. It is a good use of my _money_.
5. It _respects_ me in the level of safety, comfort, and amenity it provides.
6. I can _trust_ it.
7. It give me _freedom_ to change my plans.

[p. 26-33] specific things that transit agencies need to provide and measure to meet the seven demands (see Figure 2-1 on p. 27 of the book):

* Stops/Stations: Does it stop near me and my destination?
* Connectivity: Can I get there from here?
* Frequency: What is the maximum waiting time?
* Span: Is it running when I need it?
* Speed or Delay: How much time will we lose along the way?
* Fare: What will it cost?
* Civility: Safety, security, amenity, courtesy, cleanliness, etc.
* Reliability: Doe it run predictably day after day?
* Simplicity: Is the network easy to remember?
* Presentation: Is it easy to learn what I need to know?

[p. 34] 7 phases of a trip:

1. _Understanding_ the service, frequency, and fare.
2. _Accessing (at the origin)_ where you will board the service.
3. _Waiting_ both in terms of time and the quality of the waiting environment.
4. _Paying_ and the form of fare collection.
5. _Riding_ in terms of length of time and quality of time.
6. _Connecting_, which involves repeating steps 1-5.
7. _Accessing (at the destination)_ from the transit stop to your actual destination.

[p. 118] Competing service goals:

* Serve all parts of the community.
* Maximize ridership with a fixed service budget.

Recorded presentation on 2012-07-12 on [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg2kE5m4exk) is a 57-minute presentation at the University of Oregon followed by 19 minutes of questions.  

* The essential task of transit: "Abundant access without personal vehicles, over distances too far to walk."  
* What if we could see our own access and mobility? Discusses maps by [walkscore.com](https://www.walkscore.com/) with isochrones for what you can reach in 15 or 30 minutes from a particular point. Note: See also [OpenTransit](https://github.com/trynmaps/metrics-mvp)'s implementation of [isochrones](https://muni.opentransit.city/isochrone).

    * Frequency
    * Span
    * Speed
    * Reliability
    * Capacity

"[headway](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/Headway)"<a name="headway-def"></a> is the amount of time between transit vehicle arrivals at a stop. Headways have a significant impact on how desirable a transit service is, because they effect:

* The time penalty for missing a train or bus
* The amount of planning and preparation needed to use transit and stay on schedule
* The amount of time lost when transit schedules do not directly conform to work, school, or activity schedules
* Average wait times
